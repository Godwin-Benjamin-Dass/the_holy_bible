    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> September 15, 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Tamil &amp; English Bible</strong> (the "App") handles information. The App is designed to provide an offline Bible reading experience in both Tamil and English.</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p class="muted">Short version: The App does <strong>not</strong> collect, transmit, or share personal information. If you enable optional features in future updates (for example cloud sync, login, analytics, or push notifications), this policy will be updated to reflect what data is collected and how it is used.</p>

    <h2>Information the App collects</h2>
    <p><strong>Current version:</strong> The App does not collect any personal data or device identifiers. All core functionality (reading, navigation, themes, and font settings) works fully offline.</p>

    <h2>Local storage</h2>
    <p>The App may store settings (such as chosen theme, font size, or bookmarks) locally on your device. These settings remain on your device and are not transmitted to any server.</p>

    <h2>Third‑party services</h2>
    <p>The App does not use third‑party analytics, advertising, or tracking services in its current form. If third‑party services are added later, this section will list them and explain what data (if any) is shared and why.</p>

    <h2>Ads and tracking</h2>
    <p>This App contains <strong>no advertisements</strong> and implements no tracking technologies.</p>

    <h2>Push notifications</h2>
    <p>The current release does not use push notifications. If push notifications are added in a future update, they will be optional and described in an updated privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>The App is intended for general audiences. The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If you believe a child has provided personal information to the App, please contact us and we will take steps to delete such information.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Because the App stores minimal data and does not transmit personal information, security exposure is limited. Please keep your device secure (screen lock, OS updates) to protect any locally stored bookmarks or settings.</p>

    <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes (for example, begin collecting personal data), we will update the effective date above and publish the revised policy. You are encouraged to review this page periodically.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: <strong>godwinsinfotech@gmail.com.com</strong></p>
